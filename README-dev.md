# Cover for Developers

Cover (short for Code Verification) is an open internet service that helps verify the code of canisters on the Internet Computer.


## Requirements ⚙
- Cargo / rust
- Candid CLI, find more [here](docs/dfx.md#developer-tools)

⚠️ We mainly support MacOS and Ubuntu (Debian). Where our dev tools target mostly MacOS (we do a best effort regarding Debian) and cloud runners primarily Ubuntu. For Windows users, we suggest use of [Ubuntu on WSL](https://ubuntu.com/wsl). If you find a lack of support on your operating system, feel free to provide a PR for support, thank you!
