## ðŸ›  Infrastructure

Cover is made up of three parts - the `Canister` (you're viewing this right now), the `Validator`, and the `Builder`. **We are actively researching ways to convert all of our infrastructure to canisters on the Internet Computer.**

Here are the validator & builder repos:

- [Cover Validator](https://github.com/Psychedelic/cover-validator)
- [Cover Builder](https://github.com/Psychedelic/cover-builder)
