> This is an alpha release âœ¨ so that developers can start to play around, test the general Cover architecture during the weekend, and provide feedback to us! The alpha registry shouldn't be considered dependable yet. We will follow-up next week with a release that will include the permissioning ruling necessary to ensure all submissions are fully trusted.

If you are Cover developer, please read the [Developer Readme](https://github.com/Psychedelic/cover/blob/main/README-DEV.md)
